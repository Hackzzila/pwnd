# Contributing to pwnd

This project is still very much WIP, so any contributions are welcome.

## Issues

Since this project is still WIP, any bugs or missing features are likely to be resolved as development continues. Generally,
you should only open an issue for extremely serious bugs, features that aren't on the roadmap, or to start a discussion
about a feature/proposal.

## Pull Requests

PRs that advance the project towards its goals are more than welcome. Ensure that your contribution maintains or improves code
quality and is well tested.

If you're interested in contributing to a particular feature but aren't sure how, feel free to open a discussion issue and we can
work through the exact implementation we're looking for.
